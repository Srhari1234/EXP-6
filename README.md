# EXP-6

Aim: 
Creating for, while, do while loops.

Theory: 
For loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times. If the number of iteration is fixed, it is recommended to use for loop whiile loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached do/while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true.
